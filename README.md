CI status: ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/js-demos/my-blog.png?branch=master)

A basic es6 project, which includes:

1. webpack
2. babel
3. express
4. jquery
5. react

All the changes to js/jsx files can be hot-reloaded in browser.

```
npm install -g babel-cli
npm install
npm start
```

Then visit <http://localhost:3000>, you will see `Hello world` on the page.

If you modify `public/hello.jsx` to change the text, you will see the changes are applied to page instantly.
